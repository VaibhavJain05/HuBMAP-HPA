# HuBMAP-HPA
The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) is working to create a Human Reference Atlas at the cellular level. Sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), HuBMAP and Indiana University’s Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center (CNS) have partnered with institutions across the globe for this endeavor. A major partner is the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), a Swedish research program aiming to map the protein expression in human cells, tissues, and organs, funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation.

We have identify and segment functional tissue units (FTUs) across five human organs and build model using a dataset of tissue section images, with the best submissions segmenting FTUs as accurately as possible.

It help accelerate the world’s understanding of the relationships between cell and tissue organization. With a better idea of the relationship of cells, researchers will have more insight into the function of cells that impact human health. Further, the Human Reference Atlas constructed by HuBMAP will be freely available for use by researchers and pharmaceutical companies alike, potentially improving and prolonging human life.
